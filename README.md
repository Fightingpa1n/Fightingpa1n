<!-- okay one thing I wanna test out real quick tho is js.
    I mean md is html and normal html supports js, but md is mostly just for styling so I assume it will not work. but I'd be a fool if I didn't try it out. I mean css works and that also has some wierd functionality like animations and stuff so I'm gonna try it out.

Js test:
<input type="button" value="click me" onclick="alert('hello!')">
